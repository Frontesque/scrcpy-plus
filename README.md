### Notice
The tools required to build SCRCPY+ v2 are getting very old. This makes it difficult to make new changes to the app. I'm currently working on a complete rewrite (v3) of the app. If you're interested in following progress on v3, feel free to join [the SCRCPY+ community Discord](https://discord.gg/APQyKz9e9w).

### Prerequisites

- WINDOWS: None; SCRCPY and ADB come packaged with the app in both the portable and installer versions.
- LINUX & Mac: Both SCRCPY & ADB need to be installed to your computer per [your distro's instructions](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#linux).

On macOS, you need to sync the dock path to the system path. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
launchctl setenv PATH $PATH
```
